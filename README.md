A Basic Binary-Perceptron Algorithm:

Implementation of a basic binary perceptron with the most basic version of the algorithm (without using pre-defined packages or libraries).
We use the binary perceptron to train classifiers to discriminate between
• class 1 and class 2,
• class 2 and class 3, and
• class 1 and class 3.

And reporting the train and test classification accuracies for each of the three classifiers after training for 20 iterations. 

Extending the binary perceptron implemented earlier, to perform multi-class classification
using the 1-vs-rest approach. Reporting the train and test classification accuracies for the
multi-class classifier after training for 20 iterations.

Lastly, adding a L2 regularisation term to the multi-class classifier implemented above with the regularisation coefficient set to : 0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0, 100.0.
